## Data

Mobility data is provided by Unacast, a location intelligence, and measurement platform. This first-party data is collected from anonymized users who have opted-in to provide access to their location data anonymously, through a GDPR-compliant framework.

Location is collected anonymously from opted in users through smartphone applications. At the device level, iOS and Android operating systems combine various location data sources (e.g. GPS, wifi, beacons, network) and provide geographical coordinates with a given level of accuracy. Location accuracy is determined by the device and is variable, but can be as accurate as 10 meters.

Temporal sampling of anonymized usersâ€™ location is also variable and dependent on app/OS characteristics and on user behavioral patterns, but it has a high-frequency overall. We selected a panel of users who were active during the period 19 March - 03 April 2020. This leads to a sample of about 17Million users with a total of about 175 billion data points over the period of study. The basic unit of information we process is an event of the form (anonymous hashed user id, time, latitude, longitude), plus additional non-personal metadata and location accuracy.

## County level

In the first process we analyzed the reduction of mobility at county level. For each day we compute the total distance of each user that made in hour a specific county
