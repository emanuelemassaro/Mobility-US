We count the difference in mobility between March 19th and March 31st.

In the map we can show a reduction of the mobility in most of the counties, while we can observe an increase of the daily mobility in some other counties.

In the next we report the average distance per day and the average radius of gyration per user per day with the difference between the business days and the weekends.

However it could be interesting to see also the long range movements across the country. In doing so we infer the location of the users for each day.


## New York City

In the first process we analyzed the reduction of mobility in NYC. We analyze more than 9 billion data points and 1'375'515 distinct users. In the Figure we report the reduction of the traveling distance in each neighborhood.

In the next figure we report the average distance per user per day in the entire City.

In the same way we report the radius of gyration.

## Comparison among cities 

We show the comparison in mobility among 5 different cities: New York, Boston, Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles and San Francsico.

We can observe a reduction of the average daily distance for New York, Boston, Chicago and Seattle, while we observe a constant trend for San Francisco and Los Angeles.
